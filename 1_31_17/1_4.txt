Question:

Palindrome Permutation:  Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.  A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.  A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.  The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

Hints:

1) You do not have to and should not generate all permutations.  This would be very inefficient.

2) What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a palindrome have? 

3) Have you tried a hash table?  You should be able to get this down to O(n) time.

4)  Can you reduce the space by using a bit vector?
