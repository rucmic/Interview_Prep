Question:

URLify:  Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.  You may assume that the string has sufficientspace at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.  (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)

Example:

~Input: "Mr John Smith     ", 13 ~Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

Hints:

1) It is often easiest to modify strings by going from the end of the string to the beginning. 

2) You might need to know the number of spaces.  Can you just count them?
