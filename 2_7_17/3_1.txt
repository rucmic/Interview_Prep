Question:

Three in One: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks. 

Hints:

1. We could simulate three stacks in an array by just allocating threee first third of the array to
the first stack, the second third to the second stack, and the final third to the third stack.
One might actually be much bigger than the others, though. Can we be more flexible
with the divisions?

2. If you want to allow for flexible divisions, you can shift stacks andround. Can you ensure
that all available capacity is used?

3. Try thinking about the array as circular, such that the end of the array "wraps around" to
the start of the array.
