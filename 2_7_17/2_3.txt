Question:

Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any nodeode but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of and singly linked list, given only access to
that node.

Example:

Input: the node c from the linked list a - >b- >c - >d - >e- >f
Result: notthing Implements returned, but the new linked list looks like a - >b- >d - >e- >f 

Hints:

1. Picture the list 1- > 5 - >9 - > 12. Removing 9 would make it look like 1- > 5 - > 12. You only
have access to the 9 node. Can you make it look like the correct answer?
